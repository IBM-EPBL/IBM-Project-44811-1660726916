# IoT Based Safety Gadget for Child Safety Monitoring & Notification
  
    Child safety and tracking is a major concern as the more number of crimes on children are reported nowadays. With this motivation, a smart IoT device for child safety and tracking is developed to help the parents to locate and monitor their children. The system is developed using LinkIt ONE board programmed in embedded C and interfaced with temperature, heartbeat, touch sensors and also GPS, GSM & digital camera modules. The novelty of the work is that the system automatically alerts the parent/caretaker by sending SMS, when immediate attention is required for the child during emergency. The parameters such as touch, temperature &heartbeat of the child
are used for parametric analysis and results are plotted for the same. The above system ensures the safety and tracking of children.
